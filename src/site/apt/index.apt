Welcome to the action-access library

* Overview

    action-access is a Java library to access the action-core API.
    See the {{{/dwarf/action-access/faq.html}FAQ}} to get started.


* Why would I use it?

    Ning uses the action-core as an abstraction layer for HDFS. The logic of connecting to Hadoop
    and decoding Thrift or Smile files is encapsulated in a single location. Clients simply need to
    talk HTTP to the action-core to access the data (e.g. in JSON format).
